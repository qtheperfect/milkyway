* Code Explanation 

** rules.js

- The transformation rules of English postfixes are stored in *_ruleArray: Array<String>_*.

- Each clause represents both an invert-transforming rule and a filter rule. 

- Custom entries can be inserted so as to capture more word variants following the examples bellow: 
   


| Rule Example      | Effect Example         |
|-------------------+------------------------|
| -s                | meets -> meet          |
| -g-n-i+e          | voting -> vote         |
| -s-e-i+y          | treaties -> treaty     |
| -g-n-i-%2-%s-%1$$ | sitting -> sit     *** |

/See [[./app/rules.js][rules.js]] for more information./
   
    *Explain:* ***
   
- %2 = A consonant letter (the second /t/ in /sitting/)
- %s = One same letter as previous deleted (the first /t/ in /sitting/)
- %1 = A vowel letter (the first /i/ in /sitting/)
- $ =  Restore one letter from the stack top ( /i/ and /t/ once deleted are restored)
